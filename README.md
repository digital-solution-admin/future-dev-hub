## üåü Featured Content

### AI-Augmented Development Flow

### Quantum Algorithm Simulator
```python
# Sample quantum computing simulation using Qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a Quantum Circuit with 2 qubits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)

# Apply H-gate to qubit 0 (creates superposition)
qc.h(0)

# Apply CNOT gate with control qubit 0 and target qubit 1 (creates entanglement)
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure both qubits
qc.measure_all()

# Execute the circuit on a simulator
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)

# Display the results
print("Measurement outcomes:", counts)
```

### Zero-Runtime TypeScript Pattern
```typescript
// Advanced type-level programming in TypeScript
type Tuple<T, N extends number> = N extends N
  ? number extends N
    ? T[]
    : _TupleOf<T, N, []>
  : never;

type _TupleOf<T, N extends number, R extends unknown[]> = R['length'] extends N
  ? R
  : _TupleOf<T, N, [T, ...R]>;

// Usage example for creating fixed-length arrays with type safety
const tuple: Tuple<string, 3> = ["one", "two", "three"]; // ‚úì Valid
// const invalidTuple: Tuple<string, 3> = ["one", "two"]; // ‚úó Error: Type '[string, string]' is not assignable to type '[string, string, string]'
```
