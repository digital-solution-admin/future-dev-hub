## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it to understand the expectations we have for everyone who contributes to this project.

## What We're Looking For

At Future Dev Hub, we focus on forward-looking, cutting-edge technologies and concepts. Specifically, we value contributions that:

- Present practical applications of emerging technologies
- Provide working code examples (not just theory)
- Explain complex topics in an accessible way
- Connect different technology domains in innovative ways
- Showcase potential future directions of software development

We're especially interested in content related to:

- AI-augmented development workflows
- Quantum computing applications
- Web5 and decentralized applications
- Advanced type systems and programming patterns
- Next-generation DevOps practices
- Post-quantum cryptography
- Immersive/spatial computing
- Edge computing paradigms
- Energy-efficient (green) programming

## How to Contribute

### Suggesting a New Topic

If you have an idea for new content:

1. Check existing issues and discussions to see if your topic has been suggested
2. Open a new issue with the "content suggestion" template
3. Describe your idea, why it's relevant to future development, and what value it provides
4. Tag it with relevant categories

### Submitting New Content

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your content (`git checkout -b content/your-topic-name`)
3. Add your content following the directory structure and templates
4. Ensure your code examples are working and well-documented
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you're adding

### Improving Existing Content

1. Open an issue describing what you think needs improvement
2. Fork the repository
3. Make your changes in a branch
4. Submit a pull request referencing the issue

## Style Guides

### Markdown Content

- Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Start each file with a title using a single `#`
- Use headings appropriately (don't skip levels)
- Keep paragraphs concise and focused
- Use code blocks with language specification for syntax highlighting
- Include images where they add value

### Code Examples

- Include comments explaining non-obvious parts
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Ensure code is functional and can be run
- Provide setup instructions where needed

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of your additions if appropriate
2. Make sure your code examples run properly
3. Verify your content renders correctly on GitHub
4. Ensure all links work correctly
5. Update any relevant indices or navigation
6. The PR requires approval from at least one maintainer
7. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your contribution

## Recognition Model

We believe in recognizing contributors. Each merged contribution will:

- Add your name to the contributors section in the relevant document
- Credit you in the README.md for significant contributions
- Potentially feature your work in our social media channels

Thank you for helping make Future Dev Hub a valuable resource for developers exploring the future of technology!
